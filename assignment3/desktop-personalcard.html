                    type of cards that people carry with them. They 
                    allow the cardholders to borrow money from the 
                    issuer with the promise of repaying the amount 
                    in full or in small amounts with interest.</p>

                    <p class="A">Almost every person can get a personal 
                        card as long as they have a credit score, 
                        but it is always not guaranteed as it is 
                        decided by the card issuer in the end. 
                        If they meet the issuerâ€™s target area, then
                        they will get accepted. If not they will 
                        be declined.</p>
                    <p class="A">Most people get Personal cards for the
                        same reasons. One, have extra
                        money on hand just in case of an 
                        emergency. Two, to get the bonus rewards 
                        of opening the card. Most 
                        banks give their consumer a bonus
                        when they open a brand new
                        account which can range from
                        $50 to a couple hundred. Three, 
                        for their worth as in cashback, points, 
                        or flights.</p>
                    <p class="A">When used correctly, credit cards
                        allow you to earn cash or other 
                        rewards for free while using it
                        regularly as an ordinary debit
                        card. It also allows the cardholder
                        to hold off paying the full amount
                        of something just in case of an 
                        emergency, but should be paid off
                        in full when the due date comes.  </p>
