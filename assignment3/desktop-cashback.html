                <p id="thirdtext">As exactly how it sounds like. You
                    get cashback every time you swipe or use your 
                    credit card. Typically, Cash Back is more widely
                    used by everyone as it is the easiest to redeem,
                    and most credit card offers 1% to 5% back on 
                    certain purchases.</p>

                    <p class="A">Most beginner credit cards offer
                        cashback for their cards as it brings
                        in more people wanting to open
                        an account with them.  </p>
                    <p class="A">Cash Back is relatively easy to understand 
                        and use. That is why most people choose 
                        to go with cash back rather than points or miles. 
                        They also offer some incentive for using the card, 
                        which in the end, helps the issuers.</p>
                    <p class="A">Getting some sort of value out
                        of using the card makes everyone
                        happy. For instance, if you spend 
                        $100 with a 5% CB. You will get
                        $5 back. It may not seem like 
                        a lot, but with a lot of usages,
                        the CB will continue to add. 
                        You can redeem them for statement
                        credit or for gift cards.    </p>
