    <!--Most of my color choices are simple and plain colors. 
        They're not too saturated, as my inspired website, Apple 
        uses simple colors as well. Here is a list of my color 
        palette: #e7e8e8, #232a5a, #393a39, #6e99bd, #f8f9f9, #b5b6b7. 
        I made it so that the header will always be one single color
         so that there is no difference. I have a blue header u
         nderneath the fixed header on the "homepage" because on 
         apple's page the header underneath the first one is a 
         different color so I chose to copy that. My "cardcategories"
         and "cardissuers" have a big semi-white subheader underneath 
         the fixed header because as a background color for the 
         options you can click. It makes them stand out more. The 
         lighter black color underneath is there to draw the 
         viewer's eyes down towards it because it is the only dark 
         color on the page so it makes you want to look at it. The 
         dark blue color at the very bottom before the footer is 
         there to showcase a promotion that is going on as of that 
         moment. in my last layout, the header is supposed to 
         overlap into two of the grids, but I couldn't figure and 
         was hoping to talk to you this week, but I was quite busy 
         with something else, so I left it in only one grid. My next 
         color is a slightly darker whiter background to make the 
         text explaining the chosen option stand out. The next is a 
         lighter white to show the separation of the two main areas.-->

    <!--For my font choices, I went with something more playful 
        because unlike Apple, my website isn't as professional and 
        clean looking. Here is a list of my fonts: Marker Felt, 
        Minion Variable Concept Regular, airal black. To be honest, 
        I didn't use much of the weights and sizes, but I still used 
        them here and there. Furthermore, I did play a little bit 
        with the line-height, word-spacing, and letter-spacing. 
        There was some stuff that I couldn't figure out and was 
        hoping that you can help me with it, but if I figure it out 
        you can ignore this.-->
