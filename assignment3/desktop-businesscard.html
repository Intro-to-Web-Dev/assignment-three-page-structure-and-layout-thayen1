                    <p class="A">Almost every business can get a 
                        business card but just like
                        personal cards. It all depends on the 
                        card issuers in the end. At the
                        same time, people like you and me
                        without a business can still get.
                        All you have to do is apply for a 
                        Sole Proprietorship, meaning it
                        is run by only one person.</p>
                    <p class="A">Most people get Business Cards for
                        multiple reasons, such as. One, keeping
                        their business and personal expenses 
                        separate for record and/or tax purposes.
                        Two, they sometimes come with special
                        offers for business cards only, such as, get
                        a certain percent off something when 
                        usingthe card. Three, it doesnâ€™t report
                        anything to their credit file such as usage.</p>
                    <p class="A">When used correctly, business 
                        credit cards, like personal credit
                        cards allow you to earn cash or other 
                        rewards for free while using it
                        regularly as an ordinary debit
                        card. It also allows the cardholder
                        to hold off paying the full amount
                        of something just in case of an 
                        emergency, but should be paid off
                        in full when the due date comes.</p>
