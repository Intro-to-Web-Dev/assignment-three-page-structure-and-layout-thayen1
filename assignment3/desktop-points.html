                    Cash Back works, but the only difference is that
                    you get a specific number of points instead of

                    <p class="A">Most mid-tier credit cards, offer
                        points instead of CB. Points can be
                        used just like CB, but they could 
                        also, be used for many other purposes
                        such as buying flights or anything
                        that could be purchase with points.</p>
                    <p class="A">Points are sometimes worth more 
                        than CB in some aspect. They hold so 
                        much more value when pairing them
                        up for like flights or purchases. While
                        using your card regularly, you can
                        earn so many points that you can
                        technically buy stuff for free.  For 
                        instance, if you earn 1 point for $1 use, 
                        and you use $100 you will get 100 points. 
                        Sometimes you can earn even more than
                        1 point per dollar.</p>
                    <p class="A">Points are sometimes worth more 
                        than CB depending on the amount.
                        For instance, if you have 70,000 points,
                        and you want to redeem them for cash.
                        Most issuers value their points to about
                        $.01 per point, which is about $700 in
                        the end, but there are times when 
                        points can be valued up to about $.02 
                        to $.05 per point which if going with 
                        the 5 cents, is about $3,500.</p>
